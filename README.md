# Drowsiness-Detection
Capturing real time frames of image as input and detect face as output using Haar Face Detection Algorithm. The major 
role of image processing phase is to recognize the face o the driver and then extract the images of the eyes. This model 
tackles the situation with the help of all this key factors by enabling an alarm system whenever it finds someone in the 
driver seat to get dizzy
